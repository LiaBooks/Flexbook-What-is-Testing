# Flexbook - What is Testing?

This book is the outcome of summer QA program called SummerQAmp directed towards fresh college interns, where they get trained as quality assurance software professionals. It is a new nationwide initiative to train a new workforce in high-tech skills and create tech jobs for American youth. The goal of SummerQAmp is to introduce Quality Assurance (QA) as a potential career path to American youth (ages 18-24) who are unaware of the opportunity by allowing them to gain valuable work experience as summer interns at software companies.
